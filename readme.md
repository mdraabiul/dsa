## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for any programmer or computer scientist. They form the foundation of efficient software development and are essential for solving complex computational problems. This repository aims to provide a well-organized collection of code examples, explanations, and resources related to data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures

In the `data-structures` directory, you'll find implementations of various data structures, including:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- and more...

Each data structure folder contains detailed explanations, implementation code, and example use cases. We encourage you to explore these data structures to gain a deeper understanding of their properties and applications.

## Algorithms

In the `algorithms` directory, you'll discover a wide range of algorithms for various problem-solving scenarios, such as:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, etc.)
- String Algorithms (String Matching, Regular Expressions, etc.)
- Computational Geometry
- random algorithm (leetcode)
- and more...

Each algorithm folder includes detailed explanations, implementation code, and example usage. You can study these algorithms to enhance your problem-solving skills and optimize your code.
